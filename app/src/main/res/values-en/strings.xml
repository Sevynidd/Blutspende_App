    <string name="AB0System_Help_Text1">All red blood cells (erythrocytes) are surrounded by a sheath.
        On this envelope there are characteristic structures (antigens) that distinguish red blood cells of one person from those of another.
        In the AB0 blood group system, the antigens on the red blood cell sheath are divided into four groups: A, B, AB and 0. \n
        Blood group A: There is only antigen A on the sheath of red blood cells. \n
        Blood group B: Only antigen B is present. \nBlood group 0: No antigens are present. \n
        Blood group AB: Both antigens A and B are present on the red blood cells.</string>
    <string name="AB0System_Help_Text2">"The blood groups can not only be distinguished by the red blood cells.
        Special proteins are found in the blood plasma: the blood group antibodies.
        These antibodies are able to recognize blood of a foreign blood group."</string>
